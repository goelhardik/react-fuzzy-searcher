            "description": "[M/V] SEVENTEEN(세븐틴) - Home\n\n‘어둠 속에 있던 나에게 새벽을 만들어 준 너’라는 의미를 담은 세븐틴의 미니 6집 ‘YOU MADE MY DAWN’은 전작 미니 5집 ‘YOU MAKE MY DAY’가 가지고 있던 서사를 완성하는 앨범으로 전반적으로 멤버들이 작사, 작곡에 참여하며 진정성 있는 음악을 선보이는 것은 물론 탄탄하고 보다 깊이감 있는 앨범으로 탄생시켜냈으며 과감히 변화한 모습과 함께 그들의 무서운 성장세를 보여주고 있다. \n\n타이틀곡 ‘Home’은 어둠 속을 밝혀주고 기분 좋은 낮을 선사했던 너에게 편안함을 느끼게 해주고 싶은 마음을 담아냈으며 좋아하는 상대에 대한 소중함을 애틋한 감성으로 표현, 서로가 서로에게 기댈 수 있는 존재로서 어떤 어려움이라도 이겨내려는 마음을 ‘집’에 비유해 풀어내어 따뜻한 가사와 섬세한 감정선으로 리스너들을 편안하게 만든다.\n\n“You made my darkness into dawn.” This message behind Seventeen’s 6th Mini Album, ‘YOU MADE MY DAWN,’ completes the narrative from the previous 5th Mini Album, ‘YOU MAKE MY DAY.’ The members of Seventeen contributed to the entire album by taking part in both composing and writing the lyrics, adding on to their genuine style and creating a stronger and deeper album. The artists continue to display their maturity by exploring different genres and styles of music.\n\nThe title track, “Home,” expresses the desire to present comfort to a loved one who has brightened the day when one was still in darkness. The emotional lyrics compare “home” to the mutual feelings of loved ones and how any obstacle can be conquered by relying on each other. The warm lyrics and delicate emotions expressed through the track looks to comfort the listeners. \n\n\n#세븐틴 #YMMD #SEVENTEEN_Home\n#SEVENTEEN #YOU_MADE_MY_DAWN #Home\n\nSEVENTEEN Official Homepage: http://www.seventeen-17.com\nSEVENTEEN Official Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/seventeennews\nSEVENTEEN Official Twitter: https://twitter.com/pledis_17\nSEVENTEEN Official Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/saythename_17\nSEVENTEEN Official Fancafe: http://cafe.daum.net/pledis-17\n\n\nⓒ Pledis Entertainment.

Sandberg (“Annabelle: Creation”) directs New Line Cinema’s “Shazam!,” the origin story that stars Zachary Levi (TV’s “Chuck”) as the titular DC Super Hero, along with Asher Angel (TV’s “Andi Mack”) as Billy Batson, and Mark Strong (the “Kingsman” movies) in the role of Super-Villain Dr. Thaddeus Sivana.  Peter Safran (“Aquaman,” “The Conjuring” and “Annabelle” films) serves as the film’s producer.\n\nWe all have a superhero inside us, it just takes a bit of magic to bring it out.  In Billy Batson’s (Angel) case, by shouting out one word—SHAZAM!—this streetwise 14-year-old foster kid can turn into the adult Super Hero Shazam (Levi), courtesy of an ancient wizard.  Still a kid at heart—inside a ripped, godlike body—Shazam revels in this adult version of himself by doing what any teen would do with superpowers: have fun with them!  Can he fly?  Does he have X-ray vision?  Can he shoot lightning out of his hands?  Can he skip his social studies test?  Shazam sets out to test the limits of his abilities with the joyful recklessness of a child.  But he’ll need to master these powers quickly in order to fight the deadly forces of evil controlled by Dr. Thaddeus Sivana (Strong).\n\n“Shazam!” also stars Jack Dylan Grazer (“IT”) as Billy’s best friend and ultimate superhero enthusiast, Freddy, part of the foster family that includes Mary, played by Grace Fulton (“Annabelle: Creation”); Darla, played by Faithe Herman (TV’s “This is Us”); Eugene, played by Ian Chen (TV’s “Fresh Off the Boat”); and Pedro, played by Jovan Armand (TV’s “Hawaii Five-O”).  Cooper Andrews (TV’s “The Walking Dead”) and Marta Milans (TV’s “Killer Women”) play foster parents Victor and Rosa Vasquez, with Oscar nominee Djimon Hounsou (“Blood Diamond”) as the Wizard.\n\nFirmly set in the DC universe but with his own distinctly fun, family-centric tone, the screenplay is by Henry Gayden, story by Gayden and Darren Lemke.  Shazam was created by Bill Parker and C.C. Beck.  Christopher Godsick, Jeffrey Chernov, Dwayne Johnson, Dany Garcia and Hiram Garcia serve as executive producers.\n\nSandberg’s creative team includes his “Annabelle: Creation” director of photography Maxime Alexandre, production designer Jennifer Spence, editor Michel Aller and costume designer Leah Butler.\n\nA New Line Cinema production, “Shazam!” is set for release on April 5, 2019.  It will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company.",

Cooper Andrews (TV’s “The Walking Dead”) and Marta Milans (TV’s “Killer Women”) play foster parents Victor and Rosa Vasquez, with Oscar nominee Djimon Hounsou (“Blood Diamond”) as the Wizard.\n\nFirmly set in the DC universe but with his own distinctly fun, family-centric tone, the screenplay is by Henry Gayden, story by Gayden and Darren Lemke.  Shazam was created by Bill Parker and C.C. Beck.  Christopher Godsick, Jeffrey Chernov, Dwayne Johnson, Dany Garcia and Hiram Garcia serve as executive producers.\n\nSandberg’s creative team includes his “Annabelle: Creation” director of photography Maxime Alexandre, production designer Jennifer Spence, editor Michel Aller and costume designer Leah Butler.\n\nA New Line Cinema production, “Shazam!” is set for release on April 5, 2019.  It will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company."
